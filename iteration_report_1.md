Iteration Report #1
Jobs from Iteration #1 Assignment:
	-Jillian: Build the layout.html, cart.html, main_feed.html files, login.html,
new_user_login.html
	-Demarco: Build the recipe_card.html and user_profile.html files
	-Keshav: Build two tables in the database to store information pulled from html inputs
	-Emory: Begin working on app.py file until html files are finished, then begin connecting
them

What was completed:
Demarco built and developed the recipe_card.html and the profile.html files. These files were created and formatted to be a rough draft of sorts for the finished product. To have the bare look and functionality built into it. The recipe_card.html file has different sections with the ingredients, instructions, and comments sections. And within the comments section there is a button to then comment on the recipe. Inside of the profile.html file, there is a section to see the users recipes and then a section for the users data such as, the username and email address. These files will ultimately be tied to the app.py file built by Emory.

Keshav created the tabletalk.db with the tables user and posts, users. The table users has columns (id, username, password), where the id is the primary key. The table posts has columns (id, user_id, title, content) where the user id is a foreign key connected to the ids from the users table.

Over Jillian’s period of work time, she developed the layout.html, cart.html, main_feed.html files, login.html, new_user_login.html files. Jillian formatted these files to the given mockups shown on the TableTalk presentation slides. The main feed file has two separate sections, one aside for friends' bootstrap cards, and another divider for the main feed of recipe posts. The login page has a section for current and new users to log into the application which will be linked and connected to the database built by Keshav. The new_user_login.html file is essentially the same set up as the login.html but asks for a few additional details. The cart file has ordered lists for each recipe but unordered elements for each recipe ingredient. All these files will continue to be tied to the app.py file built by Emory where we can have a clear navigation of the website without fancy features by next Tuesday. 

Emory created a schema.sql with tables: accounts and posts. He also created an app.py and setup database initialization, connection, closing, and accessing. He wrote code for app routes: ‘/’ (default welcome page), ‘/login’, ‘/sign_up’, ‘/show_feed’, ‘/show_cart’, ‘/show_profile’, and ‘/show_recipe_card’. The login app route checks if a username and password are in the arguments, if they are they try to access the account information saved in the database, if it exists they get sent to the main feed, if not they are kept at the login page and a flash error message gets sent. If there are not username and password arguments, they are kept in the login page and an error message gets flashed. The signup page is very similar but instead if there are username and password arguments they check if a user with the same name already exists. If they do exist, they are sent a message the username is already taken, if not a new account is created in the database and they are sent to the main feed. The main feed checks if the user is registered and if renders the main feed. The user profile checks if there is a username argument and if there is they use that to access the account id and render the user profile template with that user.

What was planned but not finished:
Over this iteration’s plan some things that had not yet been finished were the full connections between the html files and the app.py file. We plan as developers to have this done by next Tuesday. To get this done in time for the deadline we need to have all the html files correctly connected with routes to the app.py file. We also want all the user inputs correctly modified and be stored within the database where they can be inputted and accessed. Within the html files we want to replace any pseudo code blocks with the actual; connection code. After we complete all this we want to add user testing so we can see how the users actually interact with the webpage while building posts to be stored in the database and how we as programmers can throw those posts in the main feed page.

What troubles/difficulties were encountered:
No major technical issues faced yet. With continual testing and development we will note and cite any issues faced with user expected path through the website.  

What adjustments to your overall design were discovered & what approach was helpful:
The major differences we want to fix are the deletion of pseudo code and adding code which actually interacts with the database and app.py file now that we have all the separate pieces built. This is just a way to intertwine each piece and function to receive the intended output. 

Plan for coming iterations:
Our plan for the coming week is to finish the entirety of this iteration and create a clear basic wireframe for the entire webpage. After completing this, we will move on to testing user posts and interactions with the website and fetching from the database. After being able to post on the webpage we as a team want to implement special features like cooking steps and more user friend interactions like a chat or more detailed filtering of posts on feed specified to users likes. This will also include the editing of a user’s profile information and their view to other users when they click on their page. Since we all have developed our assigned parts we will all take on the task of trying to connect the html files to the actual app.py file and databases. Each time one of us competes this successfully to create a better program we will text the messages groupchat we have created to let the other group members know to merge pull requests, pull the new working version, and to know that that part has already been competed and the other developers do not need to work on that part on their own machines.
