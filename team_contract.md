A Team Contract is a document prepared by each team prior to starting work on group projects. Students should be held accountable and responsible for their own actions. Students will develop their own "rules of engagement" through the development of a Team Contract. This contract provides an opportunity for your group to specify preferred methods of communication, action plans, meeting schedules, goals, and consequences of actions (or inactions) of group members. The contract should be developed and signed **BEFORE** starting the actual course project. For the Team Contract to be valid, provide the signed and dated original contract to me by the specified deadline on your course schedule. Give a photocopy of the original to each group member for their records. This document is more for your group than it is for me, so feel free to tailor it to your group's needs.

### B. Team Procedures:

1. **Method for setting and following meeting agendas**
	The group will review what needs to be accomplished. During the meeting we will divy up the tasks. Each member is responsible for completeing their tasks by the agreed upon time.
2. **Method of record keeping**
	When working on the project, the team member working is responcible for documenting the time that they worked in our shared google spreadsheet.
3. **Procedures in the absence of a team member**
	The team will still meet if a member is absent.

### C. Team Participation:

1. **Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:**
	When meeting each week, tasks will be distributed in the most fair way possible. If later it is discovered that someone needs help or has an abundance of work compaired to the rest of the team, they can get help from the other members.
2. **Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members**
	All ideas are welcome from all memebers and can be voted on by the team to be implemented.
3. **Strategies for keeping on task**
	During class time assigned to work on the project, only work on the project. Complete all tasks by the assigned deadline.

### D. Personal Accountability:

1. **Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:**
2. **Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:**
3. **Expected level of communication with other team members:**
4. **Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks.**

### E. Consequences of breach of contract:

What procedures and penalties do you wish to implement in the case of "slackers" or team members who deviate from your Team Contract? You basically have two options here: 1.) No Peer Evaluation or 2.) Peer Evaluation. Either option is acceptable to me, but I strongly advise you implement Peer Evaluation so that you have a mechanism in place if problems arise.

1. **Peer Evaluation**: 
	Our team will conduct peer evaluation as part of this project. Discuss group norms for handling peer evaluations and state them here. 

### F. Changes to contract:
You cannot change any aspect of the team contract, particularly the "Procedures" section, once the signed contract has been turned in to me. Therefore, be VERY SPECIFIC on the Procedures section and spend some time thinking about this section. The only way I will accept a change to your Team Contract is if ALL members of your team sign and date a written amendment to your initial agreement.
